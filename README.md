## Description <a name="description"></a>
This repository serves as a collection of all my programs written in ComputerCraft. ComputerCraft is a mod for Minecraft that adds fully functional computers into the game, running on a homemade operating system called CraftOS. Programs are all written in Lua, and since my first experience writing Lua was yesterday, this repo also serves as an archive of my adventures teaching myself the language! All code is free for you to download and use, and instructions on how to install these files in your Minecraft world are given below. Happy crafting/coding!

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To install a program (or family of programs), first make sure you have a floppy disk in your world, which has been inserted into a disk and accessed by a computer at least once. This creates a folder in your Minecraft save, which houses the entire file structure of the in-game disk. To do this, craft a floppy disk and a disk drive, place the drive next to a computer and insert the disk, then open the computer and enter the command "cd disk/". Next, you'll want to back out of your world, and download this repository. find the folder with the programs you'd like to install, and copy all but the README.md file into the floppy disk file in your save file. The location of this file depends on how you've installed your mods: if you've homebrewed a modpack, it'll be in %AppData%/roaming/.minecraft, or whatever folder you made your instance in. If you've used an installer to download a modpack, you can usually find a button in the launcher to navigate to the modpack folder. Inside your "saves" file, navigate to "computercraft/disks/[id-number of your disk]" and paste the folder. Now load up Minecraft and check your disk!

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Each program has its own use case. Refer to the README.md file in each folder to see how to use the program.
